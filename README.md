# War Wolf
- Description: This repository contains all the Creo Parametric design files as well as presentation and data files for a Trebuchet project made for an Engineering Design class at the College of DuPage in 2019.

## How to build it yourself:
- There is no guide on how to copy our design, however, you can look at the 3d files and use that to inspire or copy for yourself


## End goal of the project:
- Try to throw a tennis ball as far as possible with a trebuchet under $100 and weighing no greater than 75lbs
